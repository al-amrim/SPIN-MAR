# SPINMAR
SPINMAR is a MATLAB based custom toolkit that might be of interest to individuals who would like to generate a movement analysis report for lower limb joint kinematics. SPINMAR will load .mvnx files containing human motion capture data that have been collected with and exported from MVN Analyze software (Xsens Technologies B.V., Enschede, The Netherlands). SPINMAR will load, process, and present the kinematic data in a visual and easily accessible pdf report. Details of the processing performed and the final report can be found in [provide reference to paper].
